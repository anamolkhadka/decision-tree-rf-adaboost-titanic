Note to TA

- The Titatnic Dataset provided with both training and test Dataset.
- The test dataset comes without the class labels.
- I have splitted the training dataset into training and validation set and used it for testing the accuracy by
comparing the predicted and actual class labels for the validation set.
- For the test dataset, I have predicted the classes and saved it on the csv file.
- All the models should be working fine given that the packages are installed.
